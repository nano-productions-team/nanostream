## Setup/Contribute

1. Prerequisites:

   - Nodejs
   - Mongodb

2. Clone this repository.

3. Run `yarn` or `npm install` in BOTH root directory and client directory.

4. Create a file called: .env and copy the code inside .env.development into it. DO NOT track .env to git. Adjust variables to your liking.

5. Run the server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` and frontend React app with `yarn start` or `npm start`

6. If you are interested in making a pull request, I highly suggest you start an issue to explain your plans, even if you don't accomplish what you said.

The reason I am saying to start an issue is because just that idea you have means a lot to this project even if you couldn't code it. I want to respect and take in every single person's contribution be it through actually code or just thoughts or ideas.

## Contribute Guidelines

Pretty basic right now. Just write JavaScript and clean, understandable code. And keep the style of my code the same throughout the project.
